					Welcome to our experimental site. During this experiment you will play a shooting game. The rules are simple, you must click on the moving targets to eliminate them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note, there are a few things you need to consider before you start: 
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Don't look for performance in the game, just try to do the tasks in a natural way, there is no score and you can't lose. Just have fun.</li>
					<li>You can turn on the sound if you want, the game will be more immersive.</li>
				</ul>
